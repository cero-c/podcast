                    <p class="about-tekst">Fake news, manipulated videos, electronic interference in elections, and the
                        ever-present question: can we still trust the news? On one hand, we are deeply interested in
                        politics, but on the other, we often find ourselves doubting what to believe. This uncertainty
                        left us feeling powerless.</p>
                    <p class="about-tekst">The interest of voters and new voters in politics is gradually decreasing.
                        Was our disengagement from politics a conscious decision? </p>
                    <p class="about-tekst"> We don't think so. But if not, how did we end up here? These questions
                        ignited our curiosity and became the starting point of this podcast. So, who are we?

                <p>
                    I like to be called also as Geronimo. From a young age, I've been fascinated by politicsâ€”it's
                    like a puzzle I enjoy trying to solve. Growing up in a country that connects Asia and Europe, I
                    think that shaped my perspective and deepened my interest in the complexities of politics. Now,
                    I'm studying Communication and Multimedia Design in Amsterdam, where I'm combining my passions
                    for design and understanding the world around me.

                    My name is Scott, and I study Communication and Multimedia Design at the HvA. I've been
                    interested in politics and internet culture my whole life, and having conversations about them.
                    Media can be quite polarizing now a days, I see this everyday, so providing information about
                    issues online, and in the world makes me feel like I can help

                <p>I am a student Communication and Multimedia Design in Amsterdam. Despite my knowledge of the
                    internet and privacy online, I am often surprised to find biased content and have a hard time
                    escaping my personal bubble. This sparked my interest in algorithms and how they influence us.
                    It's important to me to help others like me find objective information so they can form their
                    own opinions.
